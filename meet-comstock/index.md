![Clueless Comstock]({{ site.url }}/images/clueless-comstock.jpg)

Barbara Comstock is an out of touch conservative who has been "representing" Virginia since 2010 when she began her lackluster career in the Virginia House of Delegates. In 2014 she began inflicting damage on the nation as a whole when she was narrowly elected to Congress.    

Comstock is a hopelessly out of touch religious extremist that has so far been able to fool some Virginians into thinking she "represents" their values. Unfortunately for her, the people of Virginia have been awakened by the tragic events of November 8, 2016.    

<h2>Highlights from Comstock's Record:</h2>
