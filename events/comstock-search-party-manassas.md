We're organizing a search party to help find Barbara Comstock! Since she doesn't have a public schedule we're going to start looking for her in places where she is likely to turn up.

We will be handing out flyers to people attending the St. Patrick's Day Parade. Since it's a high profile photo op we might even find her there!
