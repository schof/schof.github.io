title: Inattentive ADD
---

Inattentive or non-hyperactive ADD, on the other hand involves a "processing disorder". These children and adults can be looking right at you, not distracted at all, and still miss a lot of key information. They download information at a slower pace.

Because of this faulty or partial filing of incoming information, they often struggle with memory, requiring a great deal of relearning. They prefer generally to be exposed to less stimulation. They prefer to manage one thing at a time. Their problem is often in the general understanding, not the details.

They often are quiet and don't bother others. They often slip by under the radar for years allowing others to miss or minimize the ADD. Others may take over their work to help out or get things done quickly which encourages them to become more dependent.
