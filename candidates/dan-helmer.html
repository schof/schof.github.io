<h2>Position on Key Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Economy and Job Creation:</b> Dan Helmer is the descendant of immigrants -- a number of whom launched small businesses after arriving in America. As a member of Congress, he will encourage enterprise, foster a smart regulatory environment, and protect consumers.</li>
  <li><b>Foreign Policy:</b> Dan will improve our security and act as a fierce advocate for our troops and for the necessity of providing them with the training and equipment they need to do the jobs that are asked of them. He will help maintain strong alliances and will advocate for the destruction of ISIS and the prevention of nuclear proliferation.</li>
  <li><b>Veteran Issues:</b> He will ensure that our Veterans have access to high quality healthcare and resources and that the spouses of service members have the opportunity to pursue meaningful careers.</li>
  <li><b>Gun Safety:</b> Dan supports responsible firearm ownership and common-sense gun laws that keep weapons out of the hands of terrorists, criminals, and others who would do us harm.</li>
  <li><b>Health Care:</b> Our healthcare system fails to ensure that all of our citizens have access to the medical care they need -- it is also excessively expensive. In Congress, Dan will consider all courses of action -- including instituting a single payer option -- that would expand access and lower medical costs.</li>
  <li><b>Immigration:</b> Dan comes from a family of immigrants who were welcomed into the United States after fleeing religious persecution abroad. Dan will advocate in Congress for justly-administered, orderly, and welcoming immigration policies. Our nation’s border security cannot be compromised, but our safety does not require that those who wish to join us as Americans be sorted by religion, race, or sex.</li>
  <li><b>Discrimination:</b> He believes that it is the right of every American to worship, speak, vote, and love as they please. He will fight discrimination of any kind. He is also the grandson of Hollocaust survivors.</li>
  <li><b>Gender Equality and Choice:</b> Dan believes in equal pay for equal work. He believes in a woman’s right to choose.</li>
  <li><b>Social Security and Medicare:</b> Dan believes that we must provide a healthy and dignified retirement for our citizens.  Social Security and Medicare are critical to achieving that aim, and Dan will ensure that we meet our obligations to seniors by protecting these critical programs.</li>
  <li><b>Environment:</b> We do not need to choose between growing the economy and protecting the environment. Dan will encourage investment in renewable energy, secure and efficient electricity distribution, and updated transportation infrastructure because he knows that such initiatives will create high-quality American jobs.</li>
  <li><b>Education:</b> Our education system needs to prepare our children for the challenges of a competitive global economy. Dan will support policies that enable all children to thrive and that provide teachers with the support, tools, and resources they need to do the challenging work of educating future generations. Dan will work to ensure all citizens have access to a high quality college education.</li>
  <li><b>Constitutional Government:</b> Our Founders recognized that the greatest threat to the U.S. political system was an over-powerful Executive. This continues to be true. In Congress, Dan will work to restore Congress’ role in ensuring oversight of the President and protection of our Constitutional rights.</li>
