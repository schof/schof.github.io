<h2>Position on Key Democratic Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Jobs & the Economy:</b> The legislature needs to spend more time focused on improving our economy and less time on ideological pursuits and divisive social issues. We need to encourage job growth and promote small businesses. I believe the smartest investments we can make are in improving our education system and our transportation infrastructure.</li>
  <li><b>Education:</b> As a mother of two elementary-school-age sons, I know we need to keep improving our public schools. I believe that education is an investment in our economic future, and we need to treat it that way. We can do that by increasing participation in early childhood education programs, so that all children will be better able to succeed in school. We should also invest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math curricula, because those fields will lead to the types of jobs and innovations that will move Virginia forward.</b></li>
  <li><b>Women’s Health:</b> We need to protect women’s rights to control our own healthcare and keep the government out of family planning decisions. I’m pro-choice, and I was proud to vote to repeal the mandatory ultrasound law; I will continue to oppose the TRAP regulations that target women’s health clinics.</li>
