  <h3>None of These Candidates have Announced Yet</h3>
  This list was put together after interviewing numerous Democratic officials within the 10th Congressional District.
  None of these candidates have suggested publicily or privately that they are considering a run. It is still too early for candidates to announce their
  intentions but that doesn't stop us from learning more about them while we wait.
