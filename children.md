Children develop at different rates and have varied strengths and weaknesses in the course of normal development. Impairment in attention can have serious effects on academic, social and emotional development. It's important to know what a normal variation is in development and what is a problem.

Parents and teachers need to be alert to possible problems, obtain information and data to confirm or disconfirm concerns and seek professional evaluation early if warranted. If you suspect a problem - investigate. Failure to act may result in secondary emotional and behavioral problems in addition to the ADD, making recovery more difficult.
