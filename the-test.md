title: The Test
---

In order to receive a definitive diagnosis, testing should be performed by a licensed psychologist who is trained and experienced in ADD evaluations.

I prefer to use the Woodcock Johnson Test. It is actually two tests, one for cognitive ability and one for achievement. These tests provide a single source of data that is highly researched and normed against a wide range of children and adults throughout the United States.

The tests have excellent reliability and validity. I especially like that fact that most of the tests are tightly timed, with specific or subtle time limits for most tasks. In this sense, I believe the test have the ability to generalize and predict performance in the real world which moves swiftly.

A complete battery of tests provides a wealth of information that can be highly useful in diagnosing and planning.
