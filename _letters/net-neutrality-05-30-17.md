Thank you for contacting me to express your concerns regarding Net Neutrality and Internet freedom.  I appreciate hearing from you on this important issue.

Recently, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai announced his intentions to roll back Net Neutrality regulations.  I support the effort by the FCC to take the necessary steps in returning the Internet to the people.  The Internet has always thrived on innovation, not government control.  The prior Administration had reversed the decades of bipartisan support that recognized that consumers should control and drive the information superhighway â€“ not any one political party or agency.

Since Net Neutrality was implemented, it has harmed our technology sector and economy by categorizing data as a utility.  This restricts self-governance relative to other industries that also have tiered service in conjunction with variable pricing and speeds, such as our rail systems, airlines, and postal service, which has priority mail, standard, and first class.  In just two years under this regulation, domestic broadband capital expenditures have decreased by $3.6 billion. This loss of capital expenditures has hurt small Internet providers by decreasing the resources available for the necessary infrastructure investment needed to stay competitive in the marketplace.  For these reasons, I support the removal of this overreaching regulation in order to ensure the Internet remains free and competitive for all Americans.
