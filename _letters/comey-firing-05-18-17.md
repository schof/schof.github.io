Thank you for contacting me about the ongoing investigation regarding potential ties between the administration and the Government of Russia.  I appreciate hearing from you and welcome the opportunity to respond.

Following the firing of former FBI Director James Comey on May 9, 2017, I called for an independent investigation that the American people can trust.  With Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosensteinâ€™s appointment of former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel, the American people can have confidence in a fair and thorough investigation as well as confidence in the eventual outcome.

Thank you again for contacting me.  It is a privilege to serve you in the Tenth District.  I may also be contacted at my Sterling office at [703-404-6903](tel:703-404-6903), or my Washington, D.C. office at [202-225-5136](tel:202-225-5136).  By visiting [http://comstock.house.gov](http://comstock.house.gov), you can sign up to receive my email newsletters and follow my efforts to serve you.  If I may ever be of service, please do not hesitate to contact me.
