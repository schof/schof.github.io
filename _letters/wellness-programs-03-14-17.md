Thank you for contacting me about H.R.1313, the *Preserving Employee Wellness Programs Act*.  I appreciate you taking the time to write me and I always welcome you to share your comments and concerns.

The *Preserving Employee Wellness Programs Act* was introduced by Rep. Virginia Foxx on March 2, 2017.  This legislation would declare that a workplace wellness program that collects information about an employee's health history is not considered an unlawful acquisition of genetic information and does not violate the *Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990* or the *Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008*.  This legislation was referred to House Ways and Means Committee, the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and the Committee on Education and the Workforce.  Although I do not serve on these committees, please know that I will keep your views in mind should this legislation come to the floor for a vote.
