Thank you for contacting me regarding the American Health Care Act.  I appreciate you taking the time to share your views with me.  This bill addresses important issues in our health care system, but given the uncertainties in this version of the bill, as with the first version offered, I cannot support it.

We have spent weeks working with our colleagues, talking to our constituents, and hearing from medical professionals and stakeholders on the life and death issues surrounding health care and how we can transition to a better health care system.  We appreciate the hundreds of people we met with and talked to—from a variety of viewpoints—who shared their genuine concerns and health care experiences with me and my staff.  

Thank you again for contacting me.  It is a privilege to serve you in the Tenth District.  I may also be contacted at my Sterling office at [703-404-6903](tel:703-404-6903), or my Washington, D.C. office at [202-225-5136](tel:202-225-5136).  By visiting [http://comstock.house.gov](http://comstock.house.gov), you can sign up to receive my email newsletters and follow my efforts to serve you.  If I may ever be of service, please do not hesitate to contact me.
