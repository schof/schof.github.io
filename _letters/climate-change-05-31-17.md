Thank you for contacting me about climate change.  I appreciate your views and comments.

From my time in the Virginia General Assembly to today in Congress, I have been a strong advocate for an “all of the above” energy policy seeks to bolster solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, and other forms of alternative energy.  As a nation, we must strive for both energy independence as well as a reduction in emissions.

In the General Assembly, I was a patron of the _Virginia Offshore Wind Development Authority_, which now supports the development of the offshore wind industry and wind-powered electric energy facilities located off the coast of the Commonwealth.  I was also a patron of the _Green Jobs Tax Credit_, an income tax credit to encourage the creation of green jobs and to entice more alternative energy entrepreneurs to make Virginia their home.

In the 115th Congress, I have continued this trend by cosponsoring H. Res. 195, which supports finding financially responsible solutions to study and address the causes and effects of global and regional climate change.  We must take reasonable measures to incentivize the development of alternative energy sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, and biomass so that these sources become more affordable and more prevalent as their markets continue to grow.  America must harness all sources of energy in order to protect consumers and facilitate a strong and innovative economy.  At the same time it is imperative we stay globally economically competitive especially since higher energy prices disproportionality harm small businesses, families, and hinder economic mobility. I will continue to support responsible policies in Congress that both facilitate this energy approach and protect our environment.
