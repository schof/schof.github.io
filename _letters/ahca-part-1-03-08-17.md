Thank you for contacting me with your opinion on the American Health Care Act.  I appreciate you taking the time to share your views and comments with me.  In case you have not had the opportunity to review the legislation in full, you may do so by clicking [HERE](http://comstock.house.gov/sites/comstock.house.gov/files/AmericanHealthCareAct.pdf).  I look forward to keeping you informed as both the House Committee on Ways and Means and House Committee on Energy and Commerce hold public hearings where amendments will be offered and considered.

The American Health Care Act is a culmination of years of research, hearings, and input from a wide array of stakeholders including experts in health, physicians, and patients.  It is a reform package built on the flaws and lessons learned from the Affordable Care Act, also referred to as Obamacare.  This legislation is intended to be the beginning of a broader, multi-step reform process that is already underway and will continue with administrative actions by HHS Secretary Dr. Tom Price to stabilize the health insurance market, increase choices, and address costs.  Additionally, the following provisions are included in this legislation:   

* Ensures coverage for people with <u>pre-existing conditions</u>
* Preserves provision to allow young adults to <u>remain on their parents’ plans until age 26</u>
* <u>Forbids life-time limits</u> on insurance coverage
* Removes ACA taxes on prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, health-insurance premiums, and medical devices
* Provides a transition to a system in which those without coverage through government or work receive a tax credit to purchase from an expanded set of insurance options
* Establishes a Patient and State Stability Fund to provide $100 billion to states to design programs which meet their unique needs and help low-income Americans afford care
* Expands Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)
* Eliminates individual and employer mandate tax penalties
* Transitions Medicaid to a “per capita allotment” to give states more control and the ability to serve those most in need
* Bars insurers from charging more based on gender and maintains Essential Health Benefits including maternity, newborn, and pediatric care
* Provides a $422 million increase to the Community Health Center Program for FY17
* Maintains insurance for the more than 150 million Americans who receive employer sponsored health care  

In the coming weeks, we will continue to work on additional reforms to provide better, patient-centered health care.  We must ensure this care is affordable for hardworking families and individuals while protecting the most vulnerable among us.  The complexity of our health care system warrants careful consideration to ensure we have a thorough understanding of the interconnectedness of our public and private expenditures so that we produce a sustainable result and achieve sufficient enrollment to spread risk.  I look forward to our continued dialogue during this important process.
