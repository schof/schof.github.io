Thank you for contacting me regarding Congressman Steve Kingâ€™s comments.

I share your disgust with these comments and they do not represent my views or those of my party, or the vast majority of the American people. I certainly think he should apologize for these remarks, but unfortunately he has a history of making such comments and will have to answer for them to his constituents.

Thank you again for contacting me.  It is a privilege to serve you in the Tenth District.  I may also be contacted at my Sterling office at [703-404-6903](tel:703-404-6903), or my Washington, D.C. office at [202-225-5136](tel:202-225-5136).  By visiting [http://comstock.house.gov](http://comstock.house.gov), you can sign up to receive my email newsletters and follow my efforts to serve you.  If I may ever be of service, please do not hesitate to contact me.
