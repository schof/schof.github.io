If you've been following the news lately you're already aware of the [awesome billboard](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/virginia-residents-have-message-their-member-congress-do-your-job-1616592) that the grassroots funded together through your generous donations. We're pleased to announce our next initiative which is a mobile digital billboard that is also capable of video and sound.

The image below gives you an idea of how the truck will look (it looks even better at night!)

We've shown it here with the original billboard artwork but we're planning on a rotating series of issue-oriented billboards that focus on her voting record. The truck is also capable of video and sound. The picture below shows the now infamous ["elevator video"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65AKfqbjnik) but we're also planning on a series of animated spots that highlight her 100% Trump voting record.

With your help, we can fund this truck and take it all over Comstock's district. We will be making several scheduled stops so you can come out and see the truck and get free Dump Comstock swag. The only way we will defeat Comstock is if the voters learn the truth about her voting record. Donate today and help make it happen!
