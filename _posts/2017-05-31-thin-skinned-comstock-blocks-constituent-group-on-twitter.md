Over the weekend Barbara Comstock finally decided to block us on Twitter. We knew it was only a matter of time. Comstock does not like to be publicly challenged and we've been doing far too much of that lately.

What was the final straw for Comstock? Let's examine three possible explanations:

**1. Our Last Tweet**

This was our last response on her Twitter timeline:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Congress has been in session 90 days and you&#39;ve co-sponsored 149 bills in that time. You&#39;re taking credit for other people&#39;s work.</p>&mdash; Dump Comstock (@dumpcomstock) <a href="https://twitter.com/dumpcomstock/status/868219428751773697">May 26, 2017</a></blockquote>

**2. We Asked Her Some Questions**

Our group was at the May Fest in Lovettsville, VA last Saturday. Comstock turned up there and one of our members (a constituent), had a few questions. As you will see in the video we release tomorrow, she was clearly annoyed at the prospect of having to explain herself.

**3. We Embarrassed Her With a Sign**

As we've demonstrated [in the past](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eijY0Oi5HbU), she'd rather [close the door on a constituent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65AKfqbjnik) than take questions. This time when we approached her she did the following:

* Allowed a supporter to interrupt the constituent
* Ran away in the confusion
* Surrounded herself with staff
* Immediately asked the M.C. to start the event so she could get away

While we waited for the next opportunity we passed the time by holding up a few signs.

We're not sure which of these incidents pushed Comstock over the edge but we do want to point out that we are a constituent group and that we have never done anything to violate the Twitter terms of service.

It's ironic that Comstock has chosen to block us given all of the tough talk from the GOP lately. For instance this is what the Virginia GOP said after a busy morning of bashing Jennifer Wexton on Twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Of course, she&#39;s not going to see any of this because she&#39;s so thin-skinned she blocks anyone who disagrees with her on Twitter. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/va10?src=hash">#va10</a></p>&mdash; Virginia GOP (RPV) (@VA_GOP) <a href="https://twitter.com/VA_GOP/status/855067517647278081">April 20, 2017</a></blockquote>

Loudoun Executive Chair, Anthony Defazio was also very proud to point out that politics is a full contact sport:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Politics is a contact sport, and how many people you know/how many people know you is the name of the game. <a href="https://twitter.com/BarbaraComstock">@BarbaraComstock</a> will crush it. <a href="https://t.co/t7AruQoHtk">https://t.co/t7AruQoHtk</a></p>&mdash; Anthony DeFazio (@anthonyjdefazio) <a href="https://twitter.com/anthonyjdefazio/status/866764917726162945">May 22, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Since politics is a full contact sport maybe Barbara Comstock is too thin-skinned for this job?
