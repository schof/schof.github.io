Industry insiders have dramatically increased campaign contributions to Rep. Comstock at the start of her second term on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.

This is a bit ironic, considering Comstock’s track record of voting against the Silver Line and Northern Virginia transportation funding while she was a delegate in Richmond. The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/legislators-who-seem-to-like-being-stuck-in-traffic/2013/03/02/4e90ecd6-81f2-11e2-b99e-6baf4ebe42df_story.html?utm_term=.2aee1162c4e9) harshly criticized Comstock's opposition at that time, stating:

> “On her blog, she touts her recent initiatives relating to testing for Lyme disease but devotes not one word to the transportation bill, which will generate more than $1 billion annually for roads and rails.”

This has long been Comstock’s favorite political play — avoid comment on hard issues while staging photo-ops about issues everyone already agrees on.  

Comstock managed to collect just $8,400 in her first two years on the Transportation Committee.

She quickly surpassed that figure this year, collecting $8,450 from industry insiders during the first three months of her new term and adding $17,000 from corporate PAC donors.  

At this rate, she will haul in more than $203,000 before the end of the 115th Congress.

It is easy to guess what these transport corporations and industry insiders expect from Rep. Comstock: privileged access and a sympathetic ear while her constituents wait outside, clamoring for attention they will not get.

And, as if to thumb her nose at the Post, Rep. Comstock recently orchestrated a campaign photo-op for herself with [@NatCapLyme](https://twitter.com/NatCapLyme) -- a worthy cause, but one that distracts attention from her poor leadership on difficult issues.  

Like transportation.
