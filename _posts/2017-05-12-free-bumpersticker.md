Thanks to a generous anonymous donor, we now have lots of cool new Dump Comstock gear for everyone. The first order of business is to make sure all of you have one of these sweet "Dump Comstock" bumper stickers on your car.

Our stickers are high quality, scratch-resistant vinyl and they peel off easy should you need to remove it (but not until Nov. 7, 2018!)

We'll send you one now at no cost. You just need to send a Self-Addressed Stamped Envelope (SASE) to the following address:

> Dump Comstock
<br/>
> P.O. Box 1472
<br/>
> Great Falls, VA 22066

Make sure to use a business envelope since the stickers are 7.5" long which is just a bit too large for a standard size envelope.

**If all of this sounds like too much of a hassle, you can [donate $1.00](https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/dumpcomstock-sticker) and we'll send one directly to you.**
