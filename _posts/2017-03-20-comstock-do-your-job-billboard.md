Meeting in person with your constituents is a key job requirement for a Congressional representative. Unfortunately for voters, Barbara Comstock doesn't like talking to them. If you live in the 10th Congressional District you're probably well aware of the fact that Barbara Comstock does not like to attend [town halls](https://secure.politico.com/story/2017/02/barbara-comstock-no-attend-weekend-town-hall-234490). In fact, we did some digging, and it turns out that Comstock has [never held a town hall](https://dumpcomstock.com/comstock-has-never-held-a-town-hall/).

Since Barbara Comstock doesn't want to fulfill a key duty of her job, it's time someone remind her. That's why we're planning on putting up a billboard in her district as a very public reminder to all of the voters in her district.

We've found a billboard just outside of Winchester City that is **available right now**. In just a few short weeks, fourteen thousand people will have the pleasure of driving by this beautiful sign every day.

**We need your help to make this billboard possible.** As you probably have suspected, billboards are not free. That's why we need you to [donate now](https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/dumpcomstock) to help make it happen. You've been telling us for weeks that you wanted a billboard - now is your chance to make that dream a reality. As a special bonus, we are going to invite all of our grassroots donors to attend a dedication ceremony along with television and print media.

*Note: Final billboard image subject to change. We're having our lawyers review it to make sure we comply with all FEC regulations etc.*
