Who can forget the infamous [BP Oil Spill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon) and all of the nightmarish images of oil pouring into the ocean? It was such a traumatic episode in our nation's history that they even made a [movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1860357/?ref_=nv_sr_1) out of it. After the spill, the Obama administration [halted idefinitely](http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2010/05/06/06greenwire-interior-suspends-planned-va-offshore-oil-and-73308.html) a planned oil and gas lease sale off the coast of Virginia.

Yesterday, Barbara Comstock [sponsored a bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1756/text) to require the Secretary of the Interior to approve the sale. No bill text is available yet but you can tell from the title it's going to be a dramatic reversal of the common sense environmental protections put in place by the Obama administration.

You may be asking yourself why would the Congresswoman from a landlocked district be introducing a bill about offshore oil drilling? This is even stranger when you realize that Comstock is a low energy representative who rarely sponsors legislation of any kind. She introduced only [six actual bills](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse#sponsor=412658&congress=114) in the entire two years of the 114th Congress. We hesitate to even call one of those six a "bill" because it was a [single page do-nothing joke](/comstock-finally-passes-a-bill/).

On a completely unrelated note, Barbara Comstock received a [whopping $72,275](https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=2016&cid=N00036023&type=I) in campaign contributions from the Oil and Gas industry last cycle.
