The Affordable Care Act (ACA) - also known as "Obamacare" has actually been a good thing for the members of Comstock's district. Barbara Comstock has always been against the ACA and she's fought every aspect of it while it was being implemented - even the provisions that she now pretends to support. Just read what [she proudly bragged about on her own website](http://www.comstockfordelegate.com/issues/default.aspx) when running for Congress in 2014:

> "Every vote Delegate Comstock has taken has been to stop, dismantle or end Obamacare and everything connected with it including Medicaid expansion."

Last week the Democratic staff of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Oversight Committees released a report that puts some [numbers behind the devastation](https://democrats-energycommerce.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/democratic-report-examines-the-impact-of-aca-repeal-particularly-in) that ACA repeal will cause. Here are the numbers for [Comstock's 10th Congressional District](https://www.scribd.com/document/340677575/Impact-of-ACA-repeal-by-congressional-district):

* **Uninsured rate in Comstock's district has gone from 12.7% to 8.2% since the ACA was implemented.** This 4.4%
 drop in the uninsured rate could be reversed if the ACA is entirely or partially repealed.
* **39,800 individuals** in Comstock's district who have purchased high quality coverage through the Marketplace now stand to lose their coverage if the Republican Congress dismantles the Marketplace.
* **32,200 individuals** in Comstock's district who received financial assistance to purchase Marketplace coverage in 2016 are now at risk of coverage becoming unaffordable if the Republican Congress eliminates the premium tax credits.
* **22,500 individuals** in Comstock's district who are receiving cost-sharing reductions to lower out-of-pocket costs such as deductibles, co-pays, and coinsurance, are now at risk of health care becoming unaffordable if the Republican Congress eliminates cost-sharing reductions.
* **9,800 individuals** in Comstock's district who could become eligible for Medicaid if the state expanded Medicaid will now lose the opportunity to gain coverage if the Republican Congress eliminates the Medicaid expansion.

Comstock never believed in the ACA and she doesn't believe in it now. Her opposition to Medicaid expansion will cost Virginia [$211 million in federal funding](http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/general-assembly/article_fb22713d-c0cf-545e-a11d-bde0aebd3462.html) this fiscal year alone. Comstock will soon have an opportunity to vote on whatever secret plan Paul Ryan is working on. Let's see if she continues to vote against the best interests of her district.
