The House Republicans announced their ACA repeal bill last night and (SURPRISE!) it [strips all federal funding](http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/03/gop-obamacare-repeal-bill-defunds-planned-parenthood-abortion-coverage.html) from Planned Parenthood. Let's be clear, Planned Parenthood is not currently performing abortions with any federal dollars thanks to the [Hyde Amendment](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/abortion/hyde-amendment). That's not good enough for abortion opponents such as Barbara Comstock who has **already voted six times** to defund Planned Parenthood - the most recent instance being [last month](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/43).

Make no mistake - Comstock is going to vote for this bill. If there's one thing Barbara Comstock is obsessed with more than the Clintons it's abortion. Comstock's record makes clear that she is an anti-abortion zealot:
