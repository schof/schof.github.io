Barbara Comstock, who literally built her career on investigating the Clintons, has suddenly lost her zest for investigating things. When she was getting ready to run for Congress she was all about [getting answers](http://bluevirginia.us/2016/08/email-exposes-barbara-comstock-personally-directing-political-attack-machine) on Benghazi.

> “We need to get to the bottom of the truth in Benghazi, and I will do that because I’ve done that before as a chief investigator in Congress,”

After more than a decade obsessing over matters such as Travelgate, Benghazi and Clinton's email server, she has suddenly lost interest in investigating things. She has literally made zero public comment about the current scandal which has plunged our country's national security apparatus into chaos. She finally managed to utter a single word tweet yesterday once her Republican master gave her permission to speak.

Comstock still refuses to call for an independent investigation into what looks to be a major breach of national security and possible acts of treason. This after she wasted millions of dollars in tax payers money investigating things as serious as breaking with tradition and firing some travel agents who worked in the White House.

Just for fun let's look next door in the VA-8 and see what a real Congressional representative is saying:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.&quot; This is a major crisis, it cries out for Congress to act. Republicans must not be silent.</p>&mdash; Rep. Don Beyer (@RepDonBeyer) <a href="https://twitter.com/RepDonBeyer/status/831713144288407552">February 15, 2017</a></blockquote>
