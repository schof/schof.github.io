Barbara Comstock is still conspicuously absent from what Senator Corey Booker has described as a "constitutional crisis" now unfolding in her own district.  Rogue border agents at Dulles International Airport are ignoring a court order to allow detainees access to lawyers. The Washingtonian reports that the [message being sent by CBP guards](https://www.washingtonian.com/2017/01/29/customs-and-border-protection-still-not-allowing-lawyers-to-see-detainees/) is:

>"It's not going to happen"

Yesterday, a federal judge in the Eastern District of Virginia ordered the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol to allow access to lawyers for those being detained.  The CBP officials at Dulles are currently in contempt of that order and provoking a constitutional crisis whereby federal marshals may soon be called upon to enforce the order.

All members of the Northern Virginian delegation have been highly visible today at Dulles Airport with one notable exception - you guessed it - Barbara Comstock.  This morning Comstock issued a tepid statement on Facebook and then made an ironic appearance at a Holocaust remembrance service instead of dealing with the unfolding crisis in her district.

Meanwhile, the rest of the Virginia delegation (and even some members from Maryland) were at Dulles in force.  The situation is still ongoing.  Call Barbara Comstock's office and demand that she intervene.
