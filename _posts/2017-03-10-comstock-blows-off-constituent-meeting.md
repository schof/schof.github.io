Barbara Comstock is on record as saying that she is avoiding town halls because she prefers to meet with constituents in small groups. That is obviously nonsense since most members of Congress spend 50% of their time fundraising and the rest of their time presumably working on important legislative issues. Meeting with constituents in small groups would be the worst possible use of Comstock's time which is why members of Congress have town halls in the first place.

According to Facebook posts, mosts of her constituents who have requested in person meetings have been offered meetings with low level staff. Sarah Woessner, however, was determined to get a meeting with Comstock herself.

Are there any afternoon options on March 9? And just to clarify, that would be a meeting with Congresswoman Comstock, correct? I would really appreciate the opportunity to meet her.

Susan Falconer, who is Barbara Comstock's chief of staff, confirmed the meeting would be with Comstock and set it for yesterday at 2:00 PM

She even followed up with instructions on how to get a parking pass.

Yes, we have placed a hold on the time slot. If you need a parking pass, please let us know the day before. We will need year, make, model, color, license plate number and state of license plate to process the application.

Take care,

Susan

Alas the meeting was later canceled because she had an important ACA briefing to attend. SAD!

Dear Sarah,

I hope you are doing well. The House Legislative on Health Care Reform under consideration by House Committees Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce just went live. Accordingly, I have to have Rep. Comstock attend the preliminary member only briefing on Thursday making her unavailable for the time slot I originally offered to you.

Would you have any availability to reschedule with Rep. Comstock on Friday, March 10th, I could look for some time slots around the afternoon vote series.

As a second option, even though Congress is in legislative session, Rep. Comstockâ€™s Legislative Aide and I will be in our Sterling District office on Tuesday (tomorrow) March 7th and Monday, March 13th for some constituent and case work meetings. Let me know if you would be interested in meeting with us particularly if the Sterling office is closer to you.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Take care,

Susan Falconer
Chief of Staff
Congresswoman Barbara Comstock

Imagine Sarah's surprise when she saw the following two tweets sent out on Barbara Comstock's official Twitter account yesterday during the same afternoon when she was supposedly too busy to meet.

Barbara Comstock doesn't want to meet her constituents. Not even in private away from the cameras and public scrutiny. She is hiding from her voters and hoping they won't notice.
