While millions of Americans were marching in the streets last weekend, Barbara Comstock was noticeably absent.  Yet another sign that she is hopelessly out of touch with the voters in her district.

When asked for comment by the [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-women-march_us_5887b5e1e4b0441a8f716a1e) she said that:

>"Republicans [are] focused on the issues they individually hear in their districts".  

Translation: she's not going to march with you commoners.  She's too busy scheming to take aware your health care.  Most likely none of the 10,000+ Virginians at the Women's March were from her district anyways - right?
