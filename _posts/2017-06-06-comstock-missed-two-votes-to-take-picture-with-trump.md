On February 28, Barbara Comstock missed two votes in order to get her picture taken with a man that she said was  "[vile](http://www.loudountimes.com/news/article/comstock_donald_trumps_comments_are_vile_and_disqualifying433)" and "[disgusting](http://loudounnow.com/2016/10/08/comstock-abandons-trump/)" only fourth months earlier.

Comstock missed two procedural votes related to HR 998 (The SCRUB Act). These were real recorded votes, unlike the voice votes she routinely misses, but then [likes to takes credit for](/comstock-takes-credit-for-a-bill-she-never-voted-for/). The first vote she missed was at [2:11 PM](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll103.xml) followed by another vote at [2:18 PM](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll104.xml). Comstock, however, decided that it was more important to attend a signing ceremony at the White House for her one page bill that [does nothing](/comstock-finally-passes-a-bill/).

The major bill signed that day was actually a piece of legislation that [killed an Obama regulation](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/28/trump-sign-bill-blocking-obama-gun-rule/98484106/) which had prevented mentally ill people from purchasing guns. No member of Congress who voted for this bill, including Comstock, wanted to be photographed signing such a horrible piece of legislation. And so, the gun bill was singed in private and the Trump team looked around for other random pieces of legislation they could use for a photo op.

Thus the Queen of Photo Ops was summoned to the White House for an appearance with a man she said she despised only 141 days earlier. Comstock then allowed herself to be used as a prop along with [the few women Trump could find](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/28/remarks-president-trump-signing-hr-321-and-hr-255) who lacked even the slightest amount of self-respect.

So Comstock skipped out her job responsibilities to get her picture taken with a sexual predator and advance her own career. This should make an excellent case study for her [Women's Leadership Program](https://comstock.house.gov/media-center/in-the-news/mclean-patch-young-women-leadership-program-accepting-applications).
