Last week, John Whitbeck, who serves as Virginia Republican Party chair, couldn't wait to get on Twitter Monday morning and tell everyone the good news about Barbara Comstock and how accessible she is.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yup, hiding from her constituents <a href="https://t.co/9hn41k5PAq">https://t.co/9hn41k5PAq</a></p>&mdash; John Whitbeck (@JohnWhitbeck) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnWhitbeck/status/846318902535708672">March 27, 2017</a></blockquote>

He was referencing this tweet by Comstock

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Joined the Korean Community Service Center leadership tonight along with <a href="https://twitter.com/TimHugo">@TimHugo</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/PatHerrity">@PatHerrity</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnCookVA">@JohnCookVA</a> and MD <a href="https://twitter.com/RepRaskin">@RepRaskin</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VA10?src=hash">#VA10</a> <a href="https://t.co/efk2XP3Hjh">pic.twitter.com/efk2XP3Hjh</a></p>&mdash; Barbara Comstock (@RepComstock) <a href="https://twitter.com/RepComstock/status/846194992184020993">March 27, 2017</a></blockquote>

Ok first of all, that's news to us that MD representative Jamie Raskin (who does lots of town halls by the way) is a constituent of Barbara Comstock.

Second, this was a $150 per person fundraiser.

Third, it was never announced by Barbara Comstock so even if you wanted to pay $150 to talk to her you wouldn't have know about the opportunity.

Fourth, the event was at the Hilton in Tyson's Corner. Once again not inside Barbara Comstock's district!

Why is the Chairman of the Virginia GOP so eager to talk about how accessible Barbara Comstock is anyways? Probably because videos like this reveal the real Barbara Comstock as someone who can't be bothered to talk to her constituents:
