Rep. Barbara Comstock has been wildly successful in extracting cash from government contractors since the 2014 election.  

Corporate officers and PACs from companies large and small are pouring cash into her campaign.  She is a reliable vote for them, and they are willing to pay for access.  

Her middle-class constituents don’t have enough money to win Comstock’s attention, so they scrape together small contributions to [rent a billboard](http://www.nbc12.com/story/35117767/citizens-demand-virginia-congresswoman-do-your-job-with-billboard) with their message.

According to records at the Federal Election Commission, Comstock [banked $29,000](http://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/971/201704149052169971/201704149052169971.pdf) from PACs connected to federal contractors in the first quarter of 2017, including:

* GENERAL DYNAMICS  ($2000)
* GENERAL ELECTRIC ($2000)
* HARRIS CORPORATION($1000)
* HONEYWELL ($2000)
* INTELSAT CORPORATION ($2000)
* L3 TECHNOLOGIES ($1000)
* LEIDOS INC. ($2000)
* LOCKHEED MARTIN ($2000)
* ORBITAL ATK INC. ($5000)
* RAYTHEON COMPANY ($3000)
* ROCKWELL COLLINS($1000)
* ROLLS-ROYCE NORTH AMERICAN ($1000)
* SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION ($2000)
* BOEING COMPANY ($2000)
* UNISYS CORPORATION ($1000)

These same PACs can give thousands more before the 2018 election.

Corporate officers and executives donate alongside the PACs, and generously opened their checkbooks for Comstock over the past two years.  Comstock’s recent donors from the federal contracting industry gave her $94,075:

Despite the obvious conflicts of interest, this is all perfectly legal and will continue unabated.  

So, the next time you receive a [desperate fundraising letter](http://inclegal.blogspot.com/2017/05/barbara-clinton-machine-is-back-and.html) from Comstock and the Conservative Action News, remember this:

She doesn’t really need your money.
