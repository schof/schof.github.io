Once again, Comstock has been dragged kicking and screaming into issuing the bare minimum [press release](https://comstock.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-comstock-statement-fbi-director) necessary to get everyone to back off and move the focus off of her. It was only four sentences long but manages to contain all four of the essential elements of a Comstock press release.

## 1. Blame Democrats and Republicans Equally

> "Both Democrats and Republicans attacked the FBI Director at various times for various reasons and called for his ouster."

This is technically true but completely irrelevant. **Neither Democrats nor Republicans were suggesting he be fired in the middle of a criminal investigation involving possible treason!**

## 2. Never blame Trump or Republican leadership

> "However, I can’t defend or explain tonight’s actions or timing of the firing of FBI Director James Comey."

Translation: "Don't blame me. It wasn't my idea." Notice how she doesn't condemn the firing? She just can't explain it. Can't even bring herself to say Trump's actions were reckless or ill-advised, let alone possibly criminal.

## 3. State the Obvious

> "The FBI investigation into the Russian impact on the 2016 election must continue."

No shit. You just wasted 13 out of your 63 words saying nothing consequential.

## 4. Commit to Nothing Specific

> "There must be an independent investigation that the American people can trust."

The only word in this entire press release of any consequence was the word **"independent"**. This represents the bare minimum shift she needed to get people to stop pestering her. It's a tiny step in the right direction.

**Here's what Comstock needs to do if she is actually serious:**

## 1. Stop Blaming Democrats

The Republicans control all of the branches of government. If the investigation is not accomplishing anything, it is entirely the Republicans fault. Stop blaming the Democrats like you did when talking to your constituent in this video:

## 2. Stand Up to Trump

It's not enough to say you are puzzled or "can't defend" what's going on. You need to stand up and condemn Trump's attack on our democracy. The voters in your district did not vote for him. This should be a no brainer.

## 3. Meet with Constituents

If you were to hold your first ever town hall you would see how nobody would have been satisfied with that statement. They would politely tell you that you didn't answer the question and then press you to answer the question that was asked. Of course you will experience criticism but that's how you get better at your job.

## 4. Tell Us Your Plan

* What does an independent investigation look like?
* How will Congress ensure independence?
* What types of resources should be provided? *(HINT: More than what was spent on Benghazi or Planned Parenthood investigations)*
* Are you prepared to stop obstructing the Democrats efforts to see Trump's tax returns?
* Should the AG and/or Deputy AG step down since you find their actions indefensible?
* How do we do this in a way to restore public confidence in Congress, the FBI and the Justice Department?
