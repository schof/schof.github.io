The Washington Post [endorsed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-posts-picks-for-congress/2016/10/22/75fe0dd2-962d-11e6-bb29-bf2701dbe0a3_story.html?utm_term=.164677c7ac00) Barbara Comstock in 2016 making a big point of how:

> "The word 'Republican' is absent from her campaign website; the word 'bipartisan' appears throughout."

Comstock has worked hard to conceal the support she gets from hard-right conservatives, while producing moderate-sounding photo-ops and tweets to deceive the press and her constituents.

But Federal Election Commission records don’t lie, and they don’t disappear:

Barbara Comstock receives [major financial support](http://www.fec.gov/fecviewer/CandidateCommitteeDetail.do?candidateCommitteeId=C00554261&tabIndex=1) from hard-right thinkers, leaders, and enablers.  

She conceals or understates their affiliation in some cases, skirting the intent of the disclosure law by listing certain donors as having no occupation, or simply listing them as “housewife” or “retired.”  For example:

* Betsy DeVos, a [billionaire business woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betsy_DeVos) and controversial Secretary of Education known for her hard-right views on [education and Christianity](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/trump-education-secretary-betsy-devos-a-win-for-the-christian-right-w470605), is listed as a **“housewife”**
* Sheldon Adelson, [casino billionaire and conservative mega-donor](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/06/30/the-brass-ring), is listed as having **no occupation** (his wife also donated to Comstock)
* Karl Rove, known for his [political dirty tricks](http://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-politicians/republicans/karl-rove-net-worth/) and his [“dark money” fund](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-hasen-green-light-for-more-dark-money-20160212-story.html), Crossroads GPS, is listed as a **“writer”**
* Duane Roberts, a generous conservative donor once described by the LA Times as [“keeper of the GOP flame”](http://articles.latimes.com/2003/oct/14/local/me-duane14) is the wealthy owner of the historic Mission Inn, Riverside CA , yet listed by Comstock as having **no occupation**
* Kelly Roberts, wife of Duane, is [COO of the historic Mission Inn](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/laura-dunn/women-in-business-qa-kelly-roberts_b_6726218.html) and is also listed as having **no occupation**
* Charles B. Johnson, [billionaire founder of mutual fund giant Franklin Resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_B._Johnson) (and who passed away in December 2016), was listed as **“retired”** when he donated to Comstock in August 2016

Comstock’s FEC filings include other conservative stalwarts listed under less disingenuous titles:

* Lewis “Scooter” Libby, [convicted felon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooter_Libby), whose [legal defense fund was managed by Comstock](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/03/us/defense-fund-raises-money-in-libby-case.html) is a Senior VP at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank
* Brian Henneberry, [Koch Industries lobbyist](https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/lobbyist.php?id=Y0000041745L&year=2016) who lives in Potomac, MD, works on “government relations”
* Michael Chertoff, [who led the Republicans' 1990s probe into Whitewater](http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/gen/resources/infocus/whitewater/cast1.html), is listed as a self-employed consultant
* Mona Charen, a hyperventilating conservative who pens breathless articles such as [“Why Doesn’t College Work for Blacks?”](https://patriotpost.us/opinion/48554) and [“Hillary Clinton’s Felonious Friends in Virginia”](https://patriotpost.us/opinion/44489) is listed as a “columnist”
* Lisa Nelson, **[of ALEC](https://www.alec.org/about/leadership/)**, “a shadowy organization [using] corporate contributions to sell prepackaged conservative bills -- such as [Florida's Stand Your Ground statute](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/04/exposing-alec-how-conservative-backed-state-laws-are-all-connected/255869/) -- to legislatures across the country” is listed as CEO
* April Ponnuru, a [conservative Arizona transplant](http://conservativereform.com/about-crn/april-ponnuru/) working for the **Conservative Reform Network** has no title but is listed simply as working on “public policy”

Comstock is a conservative wolf who dresses as a moderate politician in order to fool the press.  For those unable or willing to see this, we’ll paraphrase a Japanese proverb for you to consider:  

When the character of a woman is not clear to you, look at her friends.
