The question on everyone's mind right now is "Who is going to run against Barbara Comstock?" Like you, we were anxious to learn more so we could get involved. It's a complicated process but it's important for everyone to understand.

## 10th Congressional Committee

The nominating process is controlled by the [10th Congressional Committee](http://www.10thcdvadems.org/). We could go into more detail about the members of this committee (we spoke to several of them) but we'll skip that for now. The reason being that the members of this committee are all subject to change this May.

Every four years, all of the congressional district committees in Virginia are "reorganized." Each district has a conference with delegates from each of the [local committees](http://www.10thcdvadems.org/?page_id=15) sending members in proportion to their representation in the district. The exact date of the conference is still being decided but we know that it will be held on a Saturday in May somewhere in the Ashburn area. The committee is still choosing between a few different dates and venues.
