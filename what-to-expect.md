Testing consists of two in person visits to my office. In the first session I will conduct a patient interview and then conduct the testing. There will then be a follow up session where I will go over the results and make additional recommendations.

## First Session

* Diagnostic interview and history (generally an hour)
* Brief introductory discussion of the purpose and procedures
* Plan for breaks and checks on fatigue level at several points
* Parents generally sit in on testing (children don't mind!)
* Children find the varied tasks interesting and are often eager to continue

## Second Session

* Extensive written report is prepared
* Results are explained in easy to understand language
* Parents will receive a copy of the report
* Copies of the report are sent to the primary care provider and others as needed
* Recommendations are discussed and refined
* Counseling needs, if any are discussed
* Arrangements are made to consult with the primary care physician (if needed)
* Children are generally seen at a separate session to review the report and plan
