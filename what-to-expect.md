Testing consists of two in person visits to my office. In the first session I will conduct a patient interview and then conduct the testing. There will then be a follow up session where I will go over the results and make additional recommendations.

## First Session

* Diagnostic interview and history (generally an hour)
* Brief introductory discussion of the purpose and procedures
* Plan for breaks and checks on fatigue level at several points
* A few subtest are often given to reduce anxiety about the tasks

## Second Session

* Parents generally sit in on testing (children don't mind!)
* Children find the varied tasks interesting and are often eager to continue
* Most of the cognitive abilities subtests are given (with breaks)

## Third Session

* Most of the achievement subtests are administered
* Breaks are provided as needed
* Children and adults often share their academic issues between subtests

## Fourth Session

* Parents generally sit in on testing (children don't mind!)
* Children find the varied tasks interesting and are often eager to continue
* Most of the cognitive abilities subtests are given (with breaks)
