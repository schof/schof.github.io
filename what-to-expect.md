Testing consists of two in person visits to my office. In the first session I will conduct a patient interview and then conduct the testing. There will then be a follow up session where I will go over the results and make additional recommendations.

There are often several breaks in testing sessions to address fatigue issues.  Parents generally sit in on testing; children usually don't mind. Parents find observing very informative.  The tasks are varied and interesting for children and they are often eager to continue.

## First Session

* Diagnostic interview and history (generally an hour)
* Brief introductory discussion of the purpose and procedures
* Plan for breaks and checks on fatigue level at several points
* A few subtest are often given to reduce anxiety about the tasks

## Second Session

* Most of the cognitive abilities subtests are given (with breaks)

## Third Session

* Achievement subtests are often given
* Determining current academic skills is very helpful
* Academic performance may be weak due to ADD issues not academic skill weaknesses

## Final Session

* A complete, thorough report with data is presented and discussed thoroughly
* Specific course of treatment is recommended and discussed
* Specific academic accommodations and support service needs are discussed
* Report will be sent to your doctor and/or school as needed
