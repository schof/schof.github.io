ADD has been the primary focus of my practice for over 30 years. I have found this to be challenging and rewarding. It gives me great pleasure and satisfaction to finally identify a problem that children and adults have struggled with for years and to provide advice and support in managing it.

Often children and adults have emotional and behavioral issues, which are caused by or aggravated by years of frustration due to ADD. These secondary problems often mask an underlying ADD problem. I believe objective testing in the hands of an experienced professional can sort these problems out and can result in a successful treatment plan. A sound treatment plan begins with a thorough evaluation.
