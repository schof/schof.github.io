People often have preconceived ideas about ADD testing. It is important to keep in mind that the goal of ADD testing is to provide objective data to help identify the type and severity of the ADD.

Common misconceptions about testing:

* I'll fail and be embarrassed; the reality is that there are no grades, just standard scores that describe relative strengths and weaknesses.
* It will be all academic stuff and I hate tests like that; the reality is that the tests are mostly a series of puzzles and tasks that are new and somewhat interesting.
* It will take many hours; the reality is that it will generally take about two hours to complete the cognitive ability tests.
* It will be very tiring and uncomfortable; the reality is that the pace is fast and there are enough short breaks to make the time pass quickly.
* It will be very expensive; although insurance does not cover ADD testing, the cost is relatively low; use of a single comprehensive test helps reduce cost.
* Test data and reports will be relatively useless and just gather dust; the reality is that the report is extensive but easily understood and highly useful in planning.
* Testing is useful only for diagnostic purposes; the reality is that retesting on several key subtests can measure improvements with treatment.
* Testing isn't necessary to obtain extended testing time for the SATs or for accommodations at college; the reality is that a recent evaluation of cognitive abilities and academic skills is required for the SATs and for accommodations at college.
* Any testing will be sufficient for the SATs and colleges; the reality is that the evaluation and report must be very comprehensive and thorough. The Woodcock Johnson battery is accepted; others may not be acceptable.
