title: Hyperactive ADD
---

Hyperactive ADD involves a difficulty in controlling or inhibiting thoughts and actions. Children and adults with this type of ADD actually do pay attention to a vast array of information. They often prefer to be exposed to a high level of stimulation and they can often attend to several things at once.

Paradoxically, they often can "hyper-focus" on a subject of great interest. Their problem lies in the details. These ADD children and adults tend to miss many details as they dash through incoming information or quickly get bored. If there isn't enough stimulation, they will usually move, sing or talk for no apparent reason to create stimulation. They often disturb others, bringing negative attention to themselves.

These children can't be missed or ignored. Others try to reign in the ADD child or adult, often leading to unpleasant arguments and conflict.
