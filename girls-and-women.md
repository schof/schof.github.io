ADD is generally manifested differently in girls and women. They tend to be less physically active and less disruptive. They are likely to be fidgety, restless and inattentive. They may slide under the radar for several school years since they don't disturb others and since they tend to have a stronger oral and written language skills than boys.

As the quantity and complexity of the work increases in later grades, failure and frustration may trigger a referral for evaluation of ADD. Look for possible problems early, don't wait for them to become obvious.
